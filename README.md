The importation of payment points in [Monty](http://www.montyglobal.es/) has always been a tedious and difficult process of maintenance and control. The fact that each of the correspondents communicates their payment points in different formats and channels caused that, as a first solution, Monty opted to carry out a previous elimination of all these payment points and a later load with the new listing.

This solution has worked until today and, although no management or reporting by payment points has been possible, Monty has not felt the need to analyze and look for a more flexible solution. Up to now. The functionalities that are required in other internal projects for the control, monitoring and management of payment points have made it essential to carry out an analysis of this process in order to obtain an import of payment points that implies a univocal identification of each one of them.

This is the birth of the Willyfog project, which includes the analysis and development of this process of importing payment points having these payment points persistently identified.
